                    James wants to propose to his woman Mary. He searches for a suitable engagement ring in the
                    Internet. He finds one, clicks the link and a page opens with the following text: 'Sorry, that page
                    doesn't exist'. As a result, James thinks 'this must be a bad omen' and closes your site.

                                We regularly check for the existence of pages. This process is automated. The check is
                                based on certain parameters given in advance. It factors in all the intricacies involved
                                in running advertising campaigns. This solution prevents ads leading to non-existent
                                pages from being displayed. Amid the large number of advertising campaigns existing and
                                challenges in creating ads, an automated check would help save your advertising budget.
                                From our experience, you will be able to save up to 5%, as well as n man-hours unlike,
                                for example, when you decide to deal with this problem manually via your SEM managers.

                    Mary is busy searching on Google on what to wear for a date. James has finally invited her for a date at a restaurant but she has nothing to wear. Finally she sees her dream dress on the internet, clicks on the ad, but ... the dress is no longer available. Annoyingly, Mary thinks "this date wasn't meant to be" and stays at home, without a dress and without James.

                                Such errors are typical in situations where an ad was launched, but the advertiser did not consider that the quantity of goods in stock is very small, thus the stock finished almost immediately after the ad was launched. Or the ad was launched, and the product was so popular that the entire stock was sold out in a matter of hours.

                                We can validate your stock level before you run your ad campaign. We implement this by connecting to your inventory system via API. We also constantly check your stock levels during the period of your advertising campaign and automatically close your ads once your stock level falls below the minimum mark or advertising in a certain region becomes impractical because the stock in the warehouse is not enough.

                    James is not giving up yet. For the second time, he googles the ring. And by the way, he sees an ad offering a 50% discount for a cute ring of your brand. He clicks expecting to see the item at half price. But when the page opens, he sees that this ring is being offered at full cost without the advertised 50% discount. "This is definitely a bad omen", - James thinks and closes your site. Forever.
