                <h2>How It Happens</h2>
                <p>
                    You have launched a new product line for your brand. You want to advertise each item in 20
                    countries, and accordingly translate them into 20 languages.

                            <p>Most Frequent

                                Every SEM manager working with Google Ads accounts receives a list of new products for
                                advertising and creates ads on his Google Ads account. The longer the list of new
                                products is, the more ads the SEM manager needs to create. This would increase the
                                workload of each employee by exactly n hours in accordance with his working speed.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="advantage-table-row">
                        <div class="advantage-table-column advantage-table-header">
                            <p>Our Solution</p>

                        <div class="advantage-table-column">
                            <p>
                                Even though accounts are different, in necessary cases, we suggest that placement of ads
                                should be centralized for all accounts. For this task, we use ad templates.</p>
                            <p>
                                The template is a pre-formed ad, with empty fields where key information about the
                                product is to be entered. You only need to fill in the necessary information about the
                                product.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <b><i>Imagine:</i></b> you fill in the necessary information about the product in the pre-generated
                    template, the
                    system duplicates the information entered in the translated copies of the template into the
                    necessary languages. Using Google Ads API, our system automatically creates ads on all selected
                    accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do you see this solution? Imagine that your SEM manager will not have to place ads for new
                    products, but that with well-designed templates in the necessary languages, the task can be executed
                    automatically. You will be able to save some new time resources for your employees, which can be
                    easily converted into cash for your company, because employees will now have time to implement other
                    tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The principle of using templates can be applied when working with remaining stock.

                    A new collection of your product has not been sold almost everywhere in 10 positions. You decide to
                    offer a 30% discount for this product.

                                Every specialist working with Google Ads accounts creates discount ads on their account.

                                Actions according to the above plan as in the case with the new collection. But you need
                                to use a thoroughly-thought-out discount template for your ad... You can take the path of
                                least resistance: in each existing template, you simply add information indicating that
                                the product is currently on a discount. Alternatively, the Adcubex team will always be
                                happy to help you develop your unique templates for future ads. This approach would
                                enable you save even n working hours for your managers and, accordingly, save your
                                advertising budget.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In turn, filling in templates can be optimized by cataloging your products... Then, with the correct
                    integration of the product catalog with the template, creating templates becomes a matter of
                    pressing a couple of buttons. We will tell you about how to use cataloging correctly in our next
                    article.

                    always possible to do this on ready-to-use pay-per-click platforms; here lie the great advantages of
